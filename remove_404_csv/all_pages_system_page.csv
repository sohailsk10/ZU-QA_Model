The article is about the significant impact that Hallyu, the “Korean Wave”, has recently had on young female Emiratis.  The university students are first interested in Korean pop music (K-pop) and Korean dramas (K-dramas) and then become more fascinated about learning Korean culture and language.  Therefore, they join Korea Clubs at universities across the UAE which is also providing a surprising benefit.  The strong interest in Korea, coupled with Korean cultural experiences within the UAE, is creating culturally competent students who are ready to join the workforce. Arab students capable of speaking Arabic, English, and Korean fluently with an understanding of Korean culture will benefit the on-going bilateral relations between the UAE and Korea. Learning Korean and learning about Korean culture has benefitted Hessa more than she could imagine.  She says, “Because of my victory, I also had the honor of being the Korean speaking host for the Emirati-Korean Cultural Festival which took place in the presence of Her Excellency Noura Al Kaabi, The Minister of Culture and Knowledge Development and President of Zayed University, as well as His Excellency Park Yang Woo, Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, including other Korean Officials at Zayed University”.
